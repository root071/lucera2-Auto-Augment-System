# Life Stone Item IDs
# ========================================
# Comma-separated list of Life Stone item IDs that trigger auto-augment
# Default includes all standard Life Stones (Mid-grade to Top-grade)

# ========================================
# User Interface Settings
# ========================================
# Show confirmation dialog before overwriting a "good" augment
# true = ask player before replacing good augment
# false = automatically replace any augment
UI_Confirm = true

# Text shown in the confirmation dialog
# You can use {AUG} placeholder to show current augment details
UI_Confirm_Text = Your weapon already has a good augment. Overwrite it?

# Show current augment details in the confirmation popup
# true = display what skills/stats the current augment has
# false = only show the confirmation text
ShowAugmentInPopup = true

# ========================================
# "Good Augment" Detection Rules
# ========================================
# These settings determine what counts as a "good" augment
# that should be protected by the confirmation dialog

# Consider ANY skill (active/passive/toggle) as "good"
# true = any augment with a skill is considered good
# false = only skills + stats from whitelist are good
GoodAugment_SkillAny = true

# Stat keywords that make an augment "good"
# Checks if augment description contains these strings
# Common stats: STR, CON, DEX, INT, WIT, MEN, P.ATK, M.ATK, SPEED, etc.
GoodAugment_StatWhitelist = STR,CON,DEX,INT,WIT,MEN

# Specific augment option IDs that are always considered "good"
# Leave empty to rely on skill/stat detection only
# Example: GoodAugment_OptionWhitelist = 16341,16342,16343
GoodAugment_OptionWhitelist = 

# ========================================
# EXAMPLES OF CUSTOM CONFIGURATIONS
# ========================================

# Example 1: Only protect augments with skills (ignore stats)
# GoodAugment_SkillAny = true
# GoodAugment_StatWhitelist = 

# Example 2: Only protect specific stats (P.Atk, M.Atk, Speed)
# GoodAugment_SkillAny = true
# GoodAugment_StatWhitelist = P.ATK,M.ATK,SPEED,CRITICAL

# Example 3: Protect specific rare augment IDs
# GoodAugment_OptionWhitelist = 16341,16342,16343,16344

# Example 4: Never ask confirmation (always overwrite)
# UI_Confirm = false

# Example 5: Custom confirmation message with augment details
# UI_Confirm_Text = Current augment: {AUG}\n\nAre you sure you want to replace it?

# ========================================
# NOTES
# ========================================
# - All Life Stones consume their respective gemstones as normal
# - The script respects server augmentation rules and fees
# - Hero weapons, cursed items, and shadow items cannot be augmented
